# Intro

Cancology.ai is a simple web app for assessing individuals based on their medical history to determe whether they're in risk of any type cancer and guide them to the right tests so that when they show up to their first oncology consultation. There is data for the doctor to readily make decisions on.


## How it works

- Working Principle: Decision Tree Classifier

- Chat-based Q&A about your health and medical history

- Once you have answered all the questions, your answers are presented to you in a structured manner.

- If you would like to change your data, redo the chats. If you're happy with your answers, you can avail our PDF functionality which allows you to save a copy of your answers + your test recommendations.

## Tech

- React, Chakra UI

- All client-side (with plans to allow the oncologist to have access to medical non personally identifiable information with your consent as mentioned in TOS)
